      My name is Nicholas, I'm a professional web developer with a passion for
      helping businesses. After years at Fortune 100 companies, I learned how
      vital technology was to scale and outpace competitors. <br /><br /> Later,
      I consulted with peers who run their own small businesses and saw mountains
      of untapped potential in their web presence. To solve this, I created this
      company to make modern, revenue-first websites accessible to any small business.
