              Hi there - I'm Nicholas, owner and sole developer of Queen City
              Design.
              <br />
              <br />
              I started programming after achieving success in the electronic sports
              industry by working for <a
                href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about"
                class="text-fuchsia-500 underline">Blizzard Entertainment</a
              > - a Fortune 100 company. Later, I wanted a career more aligned with
              my personal values and entrepreneurial ambition.
              <br />
              <br />
              In only a year, I taught myself to build websites and applications
              that solve real-world business problems which landed me positions at
              large tech companies with considerable responsbility.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over a few years of work, I was solving real problems for real businesses
              - and seeing the lucrative growth they achieved afterwards. And by
              doing so, I discovered a problem for many small businesses: <strong
                >They don't have the funds to drop thousands of dollars upfront
                on a new website</strong
              >
              - making it difficult to compete with the big players in their industries.
              <br />
              <br />
              And the ones that did... got taken advantage of. They were given terrible
              websites which looked pieced together by someone in a dungeon who hasn't
              seen design trends for the past decade. Worst of all, the website never
              focused on solving the underlying problem of <span class="italic"
                >why</span
              > they needed a website in the first place (to grow their business)!
              <br />
              <br />
              What a waste.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition, shady web developers made clients responsible for dealing
              with their own hosting service, content backups, website edits, general
              maintanence, SEO optimization and so on... unless they shelled out
              even more money.
              <br />
              <br />
              Frustrating, right?
              <br />
              <br />
              Many small businesses either can't afford a quality website, and if
              they can, they don't know who to trust to make something great without
              putting even more responsibility on themselves. Isn't the point of
              hiring someone that they solve your problem from start to finish?
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong
                >So I built a business model to fit their needs: The $0 down and
                $199 a month model.</strong
              > It's managable for a small business's bank account and comes with
              the peace of mind they'll have a strong, revenue-generating web presence
              to get them closer to their #1 goal: Growing their business.
              <br />
